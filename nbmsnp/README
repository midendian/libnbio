nbmsnp is small implemention of Microsoft's MSNP Instant Messenging
protocol.  Since IM is apparently my forte, and I know it well and can test it
quickly and painlessly, I chose an IM protocol as a test client for libnbio.
Specifically I chose MSNP because of it is the most I/O intensive that I
know of -- connections opening all the time, along with the servers going
up and down on a regular basis.  It seems like the perfect stress test for an
I/O library.  It also uses delimited streams instead of binary headers like 
some of the other protocols.

The point is that this is here for testing only, and not meant to be useful.
Messages it receives are dropped.
